# Mandalla's Flower âœ¨

## **Mandalla ðŸŒº**
- is a geometric figure representing a universe in Hindu and Buddhist symbolism.
## **Yellow ðŸŒ»**
- represents wisdom, laughter and happiness.

I chose this design to dominate the optimistic perspective in the universe. As the yellow color serves as the light in the dark background. Therefore, in every darkness there will a light that serves hope and purpose to the people.
